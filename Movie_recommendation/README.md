# Movie Recommendation Agent

## Overview
The Movie Recommendation System is a personalized agent designed to help users discover movies based on their preferences. The system leverages web search and language models (LLMs) to provide curated recommendations for movies across various genres and categories. It aims to offer tailored suggestions that match the user's taste, ensuring a high-quality movie-watching experience.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to:

1. Understand the user's movie preferences via natural language input.
2. Use web search (via EXA) to find the best movie options.
3. Provide personalized movie recommendations by analyzing:
   - Movie title & release year
   - Genre & subgenres with emoji indicators
   - IMDb ratings (7.5+ rated films)
   - Runtime & primary language
   - Engaging plot summary
   - Content advisory / age rating
   - Notable cast & director

## Tools Used
1. **Gemini (LLM)**
   - Model: gemini-2.0-flash-exp
   - The Gemini model is used for processing user queries and providing personalized recommendations based on movie data retrieved.

2. **EXA**
   - EXA is used as the tool for performing web searches to gather movie data from external sources.
   - It helps the system to identify relevant movies based on user queries and preferences.

## Project Flow
1. **User Input:**
   - The user inputs a query asking for movie recommendations (e.g., "I want to watch a horror movie").

2. **Web Search:**
   - EXA performs a web search to gather a list of relevant movies based on the user's query.

3. **LLM Processing:**
   - The extracted movie data is passed through the Gemini LLM.
   - Gemini processes the movie data and enhances the recommendations by personalizing them based on:
     - Movie title & release year
     - Genre & subgenres (with emojis)
     - IMDb ratings (focus on movies with 7.5+ ratings)
     - Runtime & language
     - Plot summary
     - Content advisory / age ratings
     - Cast & director

4. **Output:**
   - The agent crafts a detailed, personalized list of movie recommendations in an easily readable format (Markdown).
   - The system ensures a diverse set of movie suggestions, including classics, hidden gems, and trending films.
